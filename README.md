Taking part in any of the Google Challenge is a challenge to self. This particular challenge is giving an opportunity to learn jetpack compose skills. Jetpack Compose. This is my first app with Compose and I really loved working on it. It gave me a different level of satisfaction completing this and I'm looking forward to work and learn this continously.
